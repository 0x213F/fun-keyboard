**Status**: Finished.

----------

This demo mimicks the Apple Magic Keyboard 2 on the web. Press TAB and you can see a custom control scheme. This demo could be useful when demonstrating a control scheme to users. To customize the program, follow these steps:

- Press the "Download ZIP" button.
- Open "typing.js" and edit below line 90 to customize your control scheme.
- Double click "index.html" (or open it in your favorite web browser).
- Click your cursor in the window anywhere.
- Start typing.

*Limitations*: Not all keys are supported due to issues with the web (i.e. ESC would take you out of full screen). This does not work like a touch software keyboard (i.e. does not respond to clicking or touching).

*Issues*: The keyboard doesn't scale properly with window resizing. CSS should include more backup fonts.
